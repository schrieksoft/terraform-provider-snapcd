## Schema

### Required

- `name` (String) Unique name of the Stack.

### Read-Only

- `default_output_secret_store_id` (String) The ID of the Secret Store that will be used to store this Module's outputs. Note that for an 'Output' step to successfully use this Secret Store, it must either be deployed as `is_assigned_to_all_scopes=true`, or assigned via module/namespace/stack assignment.
- `id` (String) Unique ID of the Stack.
- `trigger_behaviour_on_modified` (String) Behaviour with respect to applying modules within the Stack if any of the fields on the Stack resource has changed. Must be one of 'TriggerAllImmediately' or 'DoNotTrigger'. Setting to 'TriggerAllImmediately' will trigger *all* Modules within the Stack to run an apply Job simultaneously. Setting to 'DoNotTrigger' will do nothing. The default (and recommended) setting is 'DoNotTrigger'.
