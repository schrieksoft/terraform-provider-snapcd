# snapcd_runner (Resource)

Manages a Runner in Snap CD.


## Example Usage

```terraform
// Fetch the Service Principal you created in step 1.
data "snapcd_service_principal" "my_service_principal" {
  name = "MyServicePrincipal"
}

resource "snapcd_runner" "my_runner" {
  name                       = "MyGeneralRunner"
  is_assigned_to_all_modules = true // all modules from all stacks can use this Runner. If you want to restrict this, set to "false" and then use "snapcd_runner_stack_assignment", "snapcd_runner_namespace_assignment" or "snapcd_runner_module_assignment" to assign to a narrower scope.
